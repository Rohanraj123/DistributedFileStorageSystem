Step 1: Define Goals for the MVP
MVP Features
Upload a file to the system.
Split the file into chunks and distribute them across nodes.
Retrieve a file using a unique identifier.
Ensure redundancy with basic replication.
Provide encryption for secure storage.
Implement a simple P2P network for communication.

Step 2: Overall Workflow
1. Node Setup
Nodes join the network by starting a service.
Register their presence in a distributed hash table (DHT).
2. File Upload
User uploads a file.
The file is chunked, encrypted, and distributed to nodes.
Metadata (chunk IDs and their node locations) is stored.
3. File Retrieval
User provides a unique identifier (file ID).
Metadata is fetched to locate the chunks.
Chunks are retrieved, decrypted, and reassembled.
4. Replication
Chunks are replicated to a configurable number of nodes for fault tolerance.


Step 3: Architecture
Core Components
Client Module: Handles file uploads, downloads, and user interaction.
Node Module: Stores file chunks and communicates with other nodes.
P2P Networking: Connects nodes and facilitates communication.
DHT: Stores and retrieves metadata about file chunks.
Storage Module: Manages file chunk storage on disk.
Encryption Module: Secures file data during storage and transfer.
Tech Stack
Networking: libp2p for P2P communication.
Storage: Local file system for simplicity in the MVP.
Metadata: BadgerDB or BoltDB for local metadata storage.
Encryption: Use crypto/aes for encrypting chunks.
Concurrency: Goroutines for handling multiple connections and file operations.

Step 5: Implementation Workflow
1. Networking (P2P Layer)
Use libp2p to establish communication between nodes.
Implement message types for:
File upload request.
File download request.
Node discovery.
2. File Chunking
Split files into fixed-size chunks (e.g., 1MB each).
Use hash-based chunk IDs (e.g., SHA-256).
3. Encryption
Use AES to encrypt chunks with a symmetric key.
Store the encryption key securely for retrieval.
4. Distributed Metadata
Use a DHT to store:
File ID → Chunk IDs
Chunk ID → Node IDs
Implement a simple key-value store for metadata.
5. Chunk Storage
Store chunks locally using a directory structure.
Example:

/storage/
    chunk1
    chunk2


6. File Upload
Client:
Chunk and encrypt the file.
Send chunks to nodes and update metadata.
Node:
Receive and store chunks.
Respond to replication requests.


7. File Retrieval
Client:
Query metadata for chunk locations.
Retrieve and decrypt chunks from nodes.
Reassemble the file.
Step 6: Minimal Code Snippets
1. File Chunking (Storage Module)

func ChunkFile(filePath string, chunkSize int) ([]string, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    chunkIDs := []string{}
    buffer := make([]byte, chunkSize)
    for {
        n, err := file.Read(buffer)
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        }
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }

        chunkID := fmt.Sprintf("%x", sha256.Sum256(buffer[:n]))
        err = os.WriteFile(fmt.Sprintf("storage/%s", chunkID), buffer[:n], 0644)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        chunkIDs = append(chunkIDs, chunkID)
    }
    return chunkIDs, nil
}


2. Basic Node (Node Module)

func StartNode() {
    host, err := libp2p.New()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create P2P host: %v", err)
    }

    log.Printf("Node started. Listening on: %s", host.Addrs())
    // Handle file storage and messaging
}


Step 7: Testing and Deployment
Testing
Unit tests for chunking, encryption, and DHT operations.
Integration tests for file upload/download in a multi-node setup.
Deployment
Run multiple nodes locally or on cloud instances.
Test file uploads and retrievals between nodes.
