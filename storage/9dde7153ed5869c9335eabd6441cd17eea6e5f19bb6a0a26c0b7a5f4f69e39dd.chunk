Core Components
File Chunking: Split files into smaller chunks for distributed storage across nodes.
Distributed Hash Table (DHT): Implement a DHT to locate files or chunks efficiently.
Replication: Ensure redundancy by replicating file chunks on multiple nodes.
Encryption: Encrypt files before storage to ensure data privacy.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking: Build a P2P communication layer using libraries like libp2p.
Consensus Mechanism: Use consensus protocols (e.g., RAFT or custom lightweight mechanisms) for agreement on data integrity.
Metadata Storage: Maintain metadata (chunk mapping, owner details) using a lightweight distributed database.
Versioning: Allow file versioning for data integrity and recovery.
Access Control: Implement public/private key-based access control for files.
Incentive Model: Design a reward mechanism for nodes contributing storage space (e.g., tokens or points).

Advanced Features
Content Deduplication: Identify and eliminate duplicate files/chunks to save space.
Erasure Coding: Use advanced algorithms for efficient fault-tolerant storage.
Immutable Storage: Enable immutable file uploads (useful for compliance and archival).
Geo-Aware Storage: Optimize storage locations based on geographical proximity.
Streaming Support: Allow partial file retrieval or streaming directly from nodes.
Caching Mechanisms: Implement local caching for frequently accessed files to improve performance.
File Sharding Across Regions: Store file shards in different regions to ensure better disaster recovery.

Development Features
API Layer: Expose RESTful or gRPC APIs for client interaction (upload/download files, check file status).
CLI Tool: Create a command-line tool for users to interact with the system (upload, download, manage files).
Dashboard: Develop a web-based dashboard for monitoring node status, file health, and storage usage.
Monitoring: Add real-time monitoring for nodes, storage, and network performance using tools like Prometheus.
Logging: Implement distributed logging for debugging and audit trails.
Optional Integrations
Blockchain: Use blockchain for file ownership verification and tamper-proof metadata storage.
IPFS Integration: Leverage IPFS protocols for content-addressable file storage.
Cloud Provider Compatibility: Offer hybrid storage, combining decentralized nodes with traditional cloud storage.
AI for Optimization: Use AI/ML to predict access patterns and optimize file placement.
Tech Stack Suggestions in Golang
Networking: Use libp2p or custom TCP/UDP implementations for P2P communication.

Databases:
Embedded DB: BoltDB, Badger.
Distributed DB: CockroachDB, Redis (cluster mode).
Distributed Storage Libraries: Explore SeaweedFS or build a custom solution.
Serialization: Use gob, protobuf, or msgpack for efficient data exchange.
Concurrency: Leverage Goroutines for managing multiple connections and file operations.
Testing Frameworks: Use Testify, Ginkgo for unit and integration tests.

Example Workflow
User Uploads a File:
File is chunked, encrypted, and stored across nodes.
Metadata is updated in the DHT.
User Requests a File:
Query the DHT for the file's chunks.
Retrieve and decrypt the chunks from nodes.
Nodes Communicate:
Nodes participate in replication, sharing load and ensuring fault tolerance.
Incentives and Governance:
Nodes are rewarded for contributing storage or penalized for going offline.
